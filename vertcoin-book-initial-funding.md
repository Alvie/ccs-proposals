## Vertcoin History 2014-2021 Book (Hardback, Paperback and eBook)

Iâ€™ve embarked to write about blockchain-based projects which have been active for at least 8 years.  As things stand, three books are nearly complete (or about to be released).  They are Groestlcoin, Syscoin and DigiByte.  The Vertcoin blockchain launched on 10th January 2014.

I propose to research Vertcoin historical events/milestones from 2014-2021 by collating information from different sources.  Bitcointalk will be researched to gain VTC history for the period 2014-2017 and I will investigate other official VTC social media accounts, blogs, articles etc for subsequent material.

I have posted examples of the Groestlcoin history book (complete) and the Syscoin history book (nearly complete) below.  The Vertcoin history book will look similar to these.

I seek funding from the community to help give me ample time to research and then write about Vertcoin.  I anticipate it will take roughly 2-3 months to complete it:

--------------------

**Initial Funding: 5,000 VTC**
- Begin researching VTC history and structuring pages

**Each following month: 5,000 VTC**

**Final Payment 5,000 VTC**

------

**Estimated Total Payment: 20,000 VTC**

If anyone has any questions, please ask @Tyke#2495 on Discord.  I have been active in the crypto space for nearly ten years.
