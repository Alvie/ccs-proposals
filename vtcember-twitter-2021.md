# SECOND GOAL REACHED! GIVEAWAY WILL PROCEED; PLEASE READ
The second goal of 1162.5 VTC has been reached and we can go ahead with the giveaway!  
It has been stable around the second goal (1180.22 VTC) which allows 3 winners per day :) The proposal will now be moved from funding required to Work In Progress. The giveaways have started on https://twitter.com/cryptovertedcom

Funding address: [vtc1qptl8hu9wvy8qyhljngtxx69vaxfrg5t3tx2z99r69dumf33juq6s4nzv9e](https://chainz.cryptoid.info/vtc/address.dws?vtc1qptl8hu9wvy8qyhljngtxx69vaxfrg5t3tx2z99r69dumf33juq6s4nzv9e.htm)

# What the proposal is about.
This proposal is for a Twitter giveaway using the hashtag "#VTCember" in order to market the halving as well as celebrations for the holiday period.
As the halving will reduce the block reward from 25 VTC to 12.5 VTC, it would be symbolic to give away 12.5 VTC.
As per the 2017 #VTCember, this was done every day to multiple users; as a result I would like to propose that we giveaway 12.5 VTC to 2 users for each day in December.
This would mean 775 VTC would need to be raised (12.5 * 2 * 31). If more funds are raised, more users may be included in the giveaway.

Rules as of right now will be (may be subject to change):

1. User must use the #VTCember hashtag in the prior 24 hours.
1. User must follow @Vertcoin
1. Anti-spam measures such as Account Age / Profile (Picture / Description) / Minimums (e.g. Followers / Following)
1. Multiple uses of the hashtag per day will not result in more entries (or perhaps capped at a certain number)
1. User cannot win more than once

Different rules may apply to different days depending on type (e.g. artwork context / riddle / meme / other). Different types of giveaways may be done per day.

# Who will complete the proposal?
This proposal will be completed by me (Alvie, /u/HyperGamers, AlvieMahmud#9999).
I will use my own Twitter account (@cryptovertedcom) in order to avoid legal / compliance issues, but may be able to occasionally retweeted via the @Vertcoin handle.
These details are yet to be finalised if this proposal is approved.

# Why it is important for Vertcoin and the community.
Marketing has been a struggle for Vertcoin due to the lack of funds.
If more people know about Vertcoin, there may be more miners and this could add additional security to the network whilst rewarding them for contributing to the network.
Hopefully, this twitter marketing will serve its purpose to show many users Vertcoin's strengths as a matured ASIC Resistant coin and highlight the upcoming halvening event, as well as allow opportunities to market:
- One Click Miner (OCM), easy to mine with your GPU
- Taproot upgrade (follows Bitcoin quickly and implements updates quickly)
- Verthash (great new algorithm giving power to the consumer miners)
- etc

# Your milestones and projected timeline
The milestone is for all necessary funds contributed to be given away by the end of 2021. This will be complete once a giveaway has been done for each day of December 2021. Excess funds may be forwarded to future proposals.

Funding can continue past 31st December 2021 as my own funds will be used, and I only expect to receive the payout after the event is over. Any excess funds will not be kept and can be redirected to other efforts
